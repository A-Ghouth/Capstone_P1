# Cloud Infrastructure Automation and Serverless Capstone

## Overview
This repository contains the code and configuration files for a capstone project focused on cloud infrastructure automation and serverless computing. The project utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to provision, manage, and deploy cloud-based resources.

## Project Components
The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Ansible**: This directory contains Ansible playbooks and roles for automating the provisioning and configuration of cloud infrastructure, such as virtual machines, networks, and security groups.

2. **Lambda**: This directory includes the source code and configuration for AWS Lambda functions, which are used to implement serverless computing capabilities within the project.

3. **Terraform**: This directory houses Terraform configuration files for provisioning and managing cloud resources, such as databases, object storage, and managed services.

4. **Supporting Files**:
   - `.gitattributes`: Specifies how Git should handle certain file types.
   - `.gitignore`: Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
   - `config.yaml`: A central configuration file used across the project components.
   - `run.sh`: A Bash script that helps orchestrate the execution of the different project components.
